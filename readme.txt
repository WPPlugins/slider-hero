== Description ==
Slider Hero is a responsive HERO SLIDER plugin that lets you create animated banners with awesome HTML5 animation effects easily.

Slider Hero can also be used to create HTML5 animated banners, HERO Banner, hero carousel, HERO Text Slider, text carousel or simple image slider. 


Marketers prefer Hero image or Hero sliders for homepage and landing pages because traditional image sliders do not convert as much as a Hero slider or animated hero image which typically occupies the most prime real estate of your website. Slider Hero provides a middle ground. It allows you to set one background Hero Image, select a GREAT javascript animation that will run on top of it and apply Title, Description and Buttons as slides on top of it. Instant awesomeness. 


There are quite a few great WordPress slider plugins available but they take a lot of efforts and expertise to produce those awesome slideshows you see in their slider demos. With Slider Hero, you can make amazing looking Homepage or Landing Page Hero Sliders easily and quickly.
